            <h4>Why?</h4>
            <p>Basically I just got sick and tired of hearing so many people talk about crypto and blockchain with absolutely no idea what they were saying, and wanted to make something to truly understand its workings.</p>
            <h4>Time Spent</h4>
            <p>Had the idea at midnight, was done by 4am. Wasnt able to fall asleep but it work worth it</p>
            <h4>Software Stack</h4>
            <p>Used truffle and ganache to deploy and host the blockchain, React.js for the front end, and thats about it</p>
            <h4>Observations</h4>
            <p>Super poorly documented, everything dates back to 2018. Even on stack overflow, all the helpfull content was from that time. Also all the tutorials and videos don't go from the basics, they skip far ahead and miss crucial steps that would leave a beginner helpless</p>
            <h4>Use Cases</h4>
            <p>No idea, but anyone who wants to have a super secure conversation can use it. Nothing is stored, no ip's, no associating information. This means you could have a conversation with a person secretly, and no one would ever know. Since you hold the encryption key, no one else can have it and its never stored anywhere</p>
            <h4>Want to contribute?</h4>
            <p>Code is completely public and it would be awesome to get more help in making it even better. Find it on github <a href="https://github.com/lennymelnik/erc.chat">here</a></p>
